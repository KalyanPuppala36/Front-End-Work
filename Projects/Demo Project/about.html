    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br />
    <p class="pro-gray">
      A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café is an establishment that primarily
      serves coffee of various types, e.g. espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Some
      coffeehouses may serve cold drinks, such as iced coffee, iced tea, and
      other non-caffeinated beverages. In continental Europe, cafés serve
      alcoholic drinks. A coffeehouse may also serve food, such as light snacks,
      sandwiches, muffins, fruit, or pastries. Coffeehouses range from
      owner-operated small businesses to large multinational corporations. Some
      coffeehouse chains operate on a franchise business model, with numerous
      branches across various countries around the world. <br /><br />

      While café may refer to a coffeehouse, the term "café" generally refers to
      a diner, British café (colloquially called a "caff"), "greasy spoon" (a
      small and inexpensive restaurant), transport café, teahouse or tea room,
      or other casual eating and drinking place. <br /><br />
      A coffeehouse may share some of the same characteristics of a bar or
      restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria. Many coffeehouses in the
      Middle East and in West Asian immigrant districts in the Western world
      offer shisha (actually called nargile in Levantine Arabic, Greek and
      Turkish), flavored tobacco smoked through a hookah. An espresso bar is a
      type of coffeehouse that specializes in serving espresso and
      espresso-based drinks. <br /><br />

      From a cultural standpoint, coffeehouses largely serve as centers of
      social interaction: a coffeehouse provides patrons with a place to
      congregate, talk, read, write, entertain one another, or pass the time,
      whether individually or in small groups. Since the popularization of
      Wi-Fi, coffeehouses with this capability have also become places for
      patrons to access the Internet on their laptops and tablet computers. A
      coffeehouse can serve as an informal club for its regular members.
